I'm just writing this to tell you to put the exe in its own folder because it will create a save file and you probably want that to be on its own and not in a sea of miscellaneous download files.

Also this is a rather incomplete draft, so some things have not been implemented yet. Feel free to save whenever you're presented with options (press S), load when you get stuck (press L), or go back. Yell at me if there's an issue or you're confused by something I wrote.
